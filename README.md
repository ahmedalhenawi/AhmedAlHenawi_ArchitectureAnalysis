README - ArchitectureAnalysis
========================================

This folder contains the deliverables for the Backend Architecture Decision Task.

Files:
- analysis_report.pdf  (main report; if not present, see analysis_report.md)
- implementation_sketches/company_a_solution.py
- implementation_sketches/company_b_solution.py
- implementation_sketches/company_c_solution.py
- performance_calculations.md

How to review:
- Read analysis_report.pdf for the 3-4 page analysis and recommendations.
- Open the implementation Python files for pseudocode sketches you can adapt.
- Review performance_calculations.md for the numeric derivations and assumptions.

Notes:
- The pseudocode is intentionally concise and designed to show architecture patterns, not production-ready servers.
- Adjust worker counts, pool sizes, and timeouts based on real metrics and load tests.
